# BMI Calculator App 🏋️‍♂️

Tired of being puzzled by the mysterious language of fitness fanatics? Fret not! We present to you the **BMI Calculator App**, your new best buddy on the journey to a healthier you. 🎉

## Why Did We Make This App? 🧐

We all know that keeping track of your health and fitness is important, but let's face it, calculating your BMI can be about as fun as watching paint dry! I created this app to make the process not just easy and quick.

## Features 🌟

- **BMI Calculation in a Blink**: Say goodbye to tedious manual calculations. Just input your weight and height, and let the app work its magic.

- **BMI Category**: Find out where you stand in the grand scheme of BMI categories – Are you an "Aero-dynamic," a "Healthy Hermit," or perhaps a "Benevolent Brontosaurus"? (Disclaimer: I might have taken some creative liberties with the categories.)

- **Measurement switching**: Freely switch between using metric and US standard calculations! I want this app to be accesible internationally!

3. Hit the 'Calculate' button. Hold your breath. Drumroll, please...

4. Voilà! Your BMI will appear, along with a quirky category name.
